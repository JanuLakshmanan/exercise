                Webtoons (Hangul: 웹툰) are a type of digital comic that originated in South Korea. While webtoons were mostly unknown outside
                of the country during their inception, there has been a surge in popularity internationally thanks in great
                part to most manhwa being read on smartphones. As digital manhwa have emerged as a popular medium, print
                publication of manhwa in South Korea has decreased. The amount of material published in webtoon form has
                now reached an equal amount as that published offline.

                <h4>
                    <u>Origins and history</u>
                </h4>
                <p> The Korean web portal Daum created a webtoon service known as Daum Webtoon in 2003 and was later followed
                    by Naver with the launch of Naver Webtoon in 2004. These services regularly release webtoons that are
                    available for free. According to David Welsh of Bloomberg, comics account for a quarter of all book sales
                    in South Korea, while more than 3 million Korean users paid to access online manhwa and 10 million users
                    read free webtoons. As of July 2014, Naver had published 520 webtoons while Daum had published 434. Since
                    the early 2010s, services such as TappyToon and Spottoon have begun to officially translate webtoons
                    into English while some Korean publishers like Lezhin and Toomics have begun to self translate their
                    works.[ Examples of popular webtoons that have been translated into English are Lookism, Untouchable,
                    Yumi's Cells, Tales of the Unusual, The God of High School, Noblesse, and Tower of God. In recent years,
                    these webtoons have been gaining popularity in Western markets, rivalling Japanese manga.[ In the past,
                    it was divided into two ratings: All (webtoon suitable for all ages) and 18 (No one under 18 is allowed
                    to read this webtoon). From May 2019, the webtoon rating system was implemented. It is said that 10 platforms
                    including Naver and Daum will participate. The ratings are expected to be △ All △ 12 years or older △
                    15 years or older △ 19 years old (18 years old) or older

                <h4>Generation Zero </h4>
                <p>
                    <img src="content/images/330px-Webtoon_Zeroth_generation.png " alt="Generation zero Webtoon">
                    <br> Earliest webtoons were scanned original comics uploaded onto the Internet, usually formatted on a one-page
                    layout.
                </p>
                <h4>First generation </h4>
                <p>
                    With the development of technology, authors were able to utilise flash animation effects.
                </p>
                <h4>Second generation </h4>
                <p>
                    <img src="content/images/330px-Webtoon_second_generation.png" alt="Generation Two Webtoon">
                    <br> Enhanced preloading enabled later authors to adopt a vertical layout with scrolling. In contrast to
                    comics with a dense panel composition, scrolling brings new panels into view. This makes webtoons suitable
                    for gradual and continuous representation, allowing webtoon reading to become more fluid.
                </p>
                <h4>Third generation </h4>
                <p>With the advent of the smartphone and tablet, webtoons have also migrated to new platforms such as apps.
                    There was also introduced sounds to imply further expressions and tones, as well as interactive motions
                    to create excitement and bring attention to certain objects for the viewers.

                </h4>
                <p>The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries with many different distributors offering original
                    and translated webtoons for users to read as well as offering platforms for anyone to upload their own
                    webtoons.

                <h5>China and Taiwan </h5>

                <p>In mainland China and Taiwan, webtoons along with web manhua have seen an increase in production and popularity
                    since they are rarely published and just like in South Korea, have resulted in a resurgence and interest
                    in the manhua industry as more content is consumed digitally. Almost all of the big webtoon portals in
                    China are offered by the big internet companies in the country while in Taiwan the bigger webtoon publishers
                    outside of the country like Comico, Toomics, and Line Webtoon are more popular since their services are
                    available there.

                <b>Korea</b> is a region in East Asia consisting of the Korean Peninsula, Jeju Island, and several minor islands
                near the peninsula. Korea has been divided since 1948 between two distinct sovereign states, North Korea
                and South Korea. Korea is bordered by Russia to the northeast, China to the northwest, and neighbours Japan
                to the east via the Korea Strait and the Sea of Japan (East Sea).</p>
